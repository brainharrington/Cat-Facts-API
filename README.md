My ultimate goal is to learn how to hit an API from a custom GPT so that I can ultimately order my own groceries from instacart with a custom GPT built for our family. We want to tell a custom GPT our likes and preferences and build it's knowledge over time of the things we like to eat and the recipes we like and the stores we shop at through instacart. Because then we want to feed it more and more complex diet goals that we're trying to hit and have it solve the ways to hit the protein levels that we want to hit as a family. And after it creates the meal plan and grocery list we don't want to have to copy paste and manually filter instacart to find each item. We want the software to find the product code of each item and just make it show up at our house.

Currently I'm waiting on API access from instacart, filled out the application on Monday October 7, 2024.

For testing I am learning how to hit the cat facts free api from a custom gpt. I wanted to use the dominos one but kept hitting the error "Error retrieving pizza items: PRODUCT NOT FOUND: 5199 CouponPizza"

I'm focusing on Python as my first language. I'm using a free account on Replit for testing and iteration. I'm then pushing the code to github for storage and deploying on Heroku which I think will be free. If Heroku ends up not being free then I'm going to upgrade Replit and just do it all there.

So far the only paid tool is $20/mo for chatGPT.
